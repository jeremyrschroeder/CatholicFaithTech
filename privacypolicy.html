	                <p>
	                    <strong>Personal data that is processed when you create a Catholic Faith Technologies account:</strong><br>
	                    When you create a Catholic Faith Technologies account, we ask you to provide your email address and name. You can choose to provide only your first name or a nickname instead of your full name if you wish.<br><br>

	                    (a) Catholic Faith Technologies processes your email address because you use your email address and your password to sign in to your account. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is based on Catholic Faith Technologie's legitimate interest in protecting the security of your account.
	                    <br><br>
	                
	                    (b) Catholic Faith Technologies also processes your email address for the purpose of sending you important information about your Catholic Faith Technologies account, such as material changes to this Privacy Policy. The name you provide is associated with your account profile, and is displayed when you submit comments or other material on a Catholic Faith Technologies Delivered website or app.<br><br>

	                    The legal ground for processing your email address and name for these purposes is Catholic Faith Technologie's legitimate interest in providing you important information about your Catholic Faith Technologies products, apps or account or material changes to this Privacy Policy, and in providing you an opportunity to engage with other Catholic Faith Technologies users.<br><br>

	                    (c) If you provide your opt-in consent to receiving marketing information from Catholic Faith Technologies, Catholic Faith Technologies will also process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about Catholic Faith Technologies products and apps. The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails.<br><br>

	                    <strong>Personal data that is processed when you purchase a product on a Catholic Faith Technologies website:</strong><br>
	                    If you purchase a product on a Catholic Faith Technologies website, then Catholic Faith Technologies will collect your name, mailing address and telephone number. We do not view or store your payment card information.   A third party (typically Authorize.Net) processes customer payment card information when Catholic Faith Technologies customers use a payment card to make a purchase on a Catholic Faith Technologies website. We recommend you carefully review&nbsp;Authorize.Net&rsquo;s privacy policy.  The legal ground for processing your name, mailing address and telephone number for these purposes is performance of a contract.<br><br>

	                    To help analyze how you and other visitors navigate Catholic Faith Technologies websites, and compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response rates, we, with assistance from third-party analytics service providers, collect certain information when you visit our site.

	                <h3>Children</h3>
	                <p>
	                    <strong>Catholic Faith Technologies is committed to children&rsquo;s privacy:</strong><br>
	                    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Catholic Faith Technologies. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age  (&ldquo;Child Users&rdquo;) in the US or as defined by your country.  Catholic Faith Technologies does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for our website, nor can they accept our terms and conditions and privacy policy. If Catholic Faith Technologies learns that Personal Information of a Child user has been collected on our website without parental consent, then Catholic Faith Technologies will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian (&ldquo;Parent&rdquo;) and discover that your Child has a registered account with our Properties without your consent, please alert Catholic Faith Technologies at <a href="mailto:privacy@catholicfaithtech.com">privacy@https://www.catholicfaithtech.com</a> and request that we delete that child&rsquo;s personal information from our systems.<br><br><br>

	                    <strong>How children may register for and use our Properties:</strong><br>
	                    Child Users cannot accept the terms and conditions and privacy policy for the MCFD site themselves. If a Child User attempts to accept the terms and conditions and privacy policy, MCatholic Faith Technologies will request the email address of that Child User&rsquo;s Parent in order to seek consent from that Parent.<br><br>

	                    If you are a Parent, you may provide consent for your child&rsquo;s registration by reading the terms and conditions and privacy policy and granting permission for your child to use the site through the link sent through e-mail.  Alternatively, you can e-mail <a href="mailto:privacy@catholicfaithtech.com">privacy@catholicfaithtech.com</a> to grant or revoke permission for your child to use the site.<br><br>

	                    Alternatively, your child can be registered to use the Catholic Faith Technologies website through his or her school, or through an integration with the Catholic Faith Technologies website that is supported by the child&rsquo;s school, or by teachers, tutors and other similar adults who assist in the educational process who have taken steps to obtain parental consent. When Child Users first log in to the system they will be asked to provide their Parent&rsquo;s e-mail address to provide consent to the terms and conditiona and privacy policy.  Access for the Child User will exire in 7 days without parental consent.  Parents always have the option to delete their Child User&rsquo;s account by e-mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@catholicfaithtech.com">privacy@mycatholicfaithdelivered.com</a>.<br><br><br>

	                    <strong>Restrictions on Child Users.</strong><br>
	                    Catholic Faith Technologies attempts to restrict a Child User&rsquo;s access to certain features that could result in disclosure of Personal Information by the Child User. A restricted account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Child User in various ways, including:
	                </p>

	                <ul>
	                    <li>Restricted accounts do not include the Child User&rsquo;s real name; only the Child User&rsquo;s username is displayed</li>
	                    <li>Child users cannot upload a photo for their profile picture.  They must choose among several avatars instead.</li>
	                    <li>The Parent can request to edit Personal Information found in Child User&rsquo;s account by e-mailing <a href="mailto:privacy@catholicfaithtech.com">privacy@catholicfaithtech.com</a></li>
	                    <li>The profile is not shared publicly, and only the Parent and other permitted administrators can see the user&rsquo;s profile</li><br>
	                </ul>
	                
	                <p>
	                    Some other features of our system may, however, permit a Child User to enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal Information that would be visible to other Users. This may occur, for instance, if a Child User enters Personal Information in answering an exercise problem or creating other projects on our Properties. If you are the Parent of a Child User, please advise your Child User of the risks of posting Personal information on our Properties or any other online services, as information posted may be used by others without restriction.<br><br>

	                    As a Parent, you can choose to share information about your child as you deem appropriate. Catholic Faith Technologies won&rsquo;t share Personal Information about your child or his/her progress with anyone other than you, your child and any permitted administrators, unless we receive your permission (or as otherwise noted in this Privacy Notice).<br><br>

	                    As a Parent, you have the ability to control information about your Child User. To review, update, or delete information collected from your Child User, you can do so in the &ldquo;Your Children&rdquo; section within your account. To refuse future collection or use of your child&rsquo;s Personal Information, you can delete your Child User&rsquo;s account or contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@catholicfaithtech.com">privacy@catholicfaithtech.com</a>.<br><br>

	                    If you would like to request removal of your or your child&rsquo;s content or information, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@catholicfaithtech.com">privacy@catholicfaithtech.com</a> for assistance.
