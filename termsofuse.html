	                Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children in any communication service. Owner does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any communication service and, therefore, we specifically disclaim any liability with regard to the communication services and any actions resulting from your participation in any communication service.

However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your submission you thereby grant Owner, its affiliated companies and necessary sublicensees&rsquo; permission to use your submission in connection with or related to the Services, including, without limitation, the rights to: copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat your submission; and to publish your name in connection with your submission.<br><br>
